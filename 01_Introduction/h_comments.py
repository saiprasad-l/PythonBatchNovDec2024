Purpose: Working with comment operator
    - Once # is encountered, complete line from that position is ignored
    - PEP 8 recommends one white space after # operator
    - comments
        - Single Line comment
        - Multi-line comment - Python doesn't support


Question: Why python dont have multi-line comment operator
Answer : Python is a interpreter based language. means each line executes

Python code --> line by line -> c code -> asssembly -> Machine


ctrl + / - multi-line comment/uncomment

print('Hello World 1')


"""


print ('Hello World2')
# print ('Hello World3)

# any operator within quotes with be treated as ordinary
print ("Hello #world4")
print ("Hello", "world5", sep="#")


print("Hello world") # 123kj12312390809i*^&*(*(*&(*
print ("Hello world7") # This is about the world
